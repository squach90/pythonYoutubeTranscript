Welcome to part two of my Steam summer
sale 2025 videos, where I highlight the
best deals and show how these games run
on the Steam Deck. You'll find a link to
part one in the video description. So,
let's get right into it. Our first game
is Planet Coaster 2, now 35% off.
Overall, the game performs great on the
Steam Deck. I recommend using the Steam
Deck preset with FSR3 set to quality
mode for the best balance between
visuals and performance. With these
settings, you'll get around 30 FPS with
2.5 hours of battery life. The next game
is Crash Bandicoot: Insane Trilogy. Now
a massive 90% off. Stick with the high
preset. You get full 60fps, great
visuals, and no compromises in gameplay.
It feels just right on the Steam Deck.
And battery life, you're looking at
about 2.5 to 3 hours, which is solid for
a game that looks this good and runs
this well. And yes, this applies across
the entire trilogy. Whether you're
playing Crash Bandicoot, Cortex Strikes
Back, or Warped, all three titles
perform equally well with the same
settings. My next recommendation is
Death Stranding now with a 60% discount.
All in all, I highly recommend the very
high settings. The game looks fantastic
and runs smoothly at around 60 FPS with
a solid 2.5 hours of battery life.
Coming up next is Control, now 85% off.
All in all, I'd recommend sticking with
the low settings. The game still looks
fantastic and runs smooth with over 60
FPS. It's the perfect balance for an
enjoyable experience on the Steam Deck.
Up next, we've got Eurot Truck Simulator
2 with a 75% discount. For Euro Truck
Simulator 2 on the Steam Deck, I
recommend using the high preset, which
provides a smooth experience with frame
rates ranging from 45 to 70 FPS. This
setting delivers a great balance of
performance and visuals with a battery
life of 3 to 4 hours.
Next is Octopath Traveler 2, now 50%
off. Octopath Traveler 2 looks stunning
on the Steam Deck and runs at a stable
60fps with the highest graphical
settings, offering a smooth and visually
beautiful experience with a battery life
of 4 to 5 hours. Let's check out EA
Sports FC 25 now 80% off. Bear in mind,
this game won't run on Steam OS. You'll
need Windows installed on your deck.
Since the performance is consistent
across different settings, I recommend
going with ultra settings for the best
visual experience.
With this, you'll get mostly 60fps with
around 2.5 hours of battery life. The
next game is Fortza Horizon 5, currently
50% off. I recommend using the low
preset for the best experience, but be
aware that there are still occasional
frame rate dips across all presets.
Next, we have Farming Simulator 25. Now,
15% off. The game runs great on the
Steam Deck. I recommend playing on the
medium preset with FSR3 set to quality
mode, frame generation turned off, and a
frame rate cap of 45 fps for the best
experience. With these settings, you'll
get around 3 hours of battery life. Now,
we have Satisfactory, currently 30% off.
Satisfactory performs well on the Steam
Deck. For the best experience, I suggest
using low settings with a locked 45fps.
Alternatively, you can opt for the
medium or high preset with a 30fps cap
if you prefer better visuals. Up next is
Lies of P. Now 50% off. For Lies of P on
the Steam Deck, I recommend playing on
the medium preset with FSR2 set to
quality. This setup provides a good
balance between performance and visuals
for an enjoyable experience. You'll get
around 60 FPS with a battery life of 2.5
to 3 hours.
Next is Medieval Dynasty on sale for 75%
off. For Medieval Dynasty on the Steam
Deck, I recommend using the medium
preset with a locked 45 fps. This setup
offers smooth and consistent performance
while maintaining great visual quality
throughout the game.
Now, we have V Rising. Uh, currently 50%
off. V Rising runs smoothly on the Steam
Deck. For the best experience, I
recommend using the high preset with a
locked 45 frames per second, providing a
great balance of performance and
visuals. With these settings, you'll get
around 2.5 hours of battery life. Now,
let's look at Rim World. Now, 20% off.
Rim World runs well on the Steam Deck
with 50 to 90 FPS in early game
scenarios and around 4 hours of battery
life. However, performance may drop in
late game with more pawns or mods. The
control scheme feels excellent on the
deck, making it enjoyable to play.
Moving on to Civilization 6. Now, a
massive 95% off. For Civilization 6, I
recommend sticking with ultra settings.
Given the turn-based nature of the game,
a steady 30 frames per second is more
than enough to enjoy a smooth and
visually rich experience on the Steam
Deck. Coming up next is Civilization 7
with a 15% discount. For the best
balance of performance and visuals, I
recommend low settings. The game remains
visually appealing while maintaining a
smooth experience.
Early game sessions provide a solid 4 to
5 hours of battery life. But as the game
progresses, and AI calculations
increase, power consumption rises. By
late game, battery life drops to around
2 to 2.5 hours, which is something to
keep in mind for longer play sessions.
Up next is Mana Lords. are currently 35%
off. With the settings shown in the
video, Mana Lords runs great on the
Steam Deck. These optimized options
ensure smooth gameplay while maintaining
good visual quality, making it a solid
experience on the device.
The next game is Frost Punk 2. Now 35%
off. Frost Punk 2 runs well on the Steam
Deck and is very playable. For the best
experience, I recommend playing on the
very low or low preset with FSR3 set to
quality, ensuring smooth performance and
good visuals.
Next up is schedule 1 now with a 30%
discount. Now, for my recommended
settings, I personally recommend playing
on high settings. The game looks
significantly better than on low or
medium, especially in terms of lighting
and shadows, but without a major
performance hit. Ultra just doesn't feel
worth the extra FPS loss in my opinion.
Next is Ghost of Tsushima Director's
Cut. Currently 33% off. For the Steam
Deck, I recommend playing Ghost of
Tsushima on the low preset with FSR 3.0
set to quality. This setup ensures
smooth gameplay while maintaining good
visual fidelity.
Next is Subnautica
on sale for 50% off. For Subnautica on
the Steam Deck, I recommend locking the
frame rate to 45 fps with the high
preset. Additionally, turn off motion
blur and set screen space reflections to
medium for optimal performance and
visuals.
Next up is Pillars of Eternity, now a
massive 75% off. The game runs great on
the Steam Deck and is very playable. For
the best experience, I recommend playing
on the high preset. With these settings,
you'll get around 60 to 70 FPS and three
hours of play time. Next up is Dios X
Human Revolution with a massive 85%
discount. The game runs very well on the
Steam Deck. For the best experience, I
recommend playing on high settings with
a locked 60fps.
Now, we have Deos XMankind Divided with
a massive 85% discount. for Deos
X-Mankind Divided on the Steam Deck. I
recommend playing on the very high
preset with a locked 30fps for the best
experience, ensuring smooth gameplay and
great visuals.
Our next game is Alan Wake, now 90% off.
Now for my recommended settings, high
settings with a 60fps frame cap. This
setup ensures consistently smooth
gameplay while optimizing power
consumption.
With these settings, you can expect a
battery life of around 3.5 to 4 hours,
making it the best way to play for most
users.
Next up is Yakuza Kiwami on sale for 45%
off. The game runs and looks excellent
on the Steam Deck. For the best
experience, I recommend playing on the
ultra preset.
Up next is Green Hell, now 75% off. For
Green Hell on the Steam Deck, I
recommend using the medium preset with a
max frame rate of 45 fps and setting the
draw distance to maximum. This
configuration offers a great balance
between performance and visual quality.
Next up is Tekken 8 with a 50% discount.
To achieve a consistent 60fps on the
Steam Deck, you'll need to play Tekken 8
on the low preset. This setting helps
maintain smooth and responsive gameplay
throughout matches.
Next is Divinity Original Sin Enhanced
Edition. Now 80% off. Divinity Original
Sin runs exceptionally well on the Steam
Deck. For the best experience, I
recommend playing on ultra settings with
a locked 60fps, providing smooth and
stunning gameplay throughout your
adventure.
Next is Tomb Raider 2013 with a massive
85% discount. for Tomb Raider 2013 on
the Steam Deck. I recommend playing on
medium settings for 90fps gameplay.
Alternatively, use the ultra preset with
a locked 60fps for the best overall
experience, offering both high
performance and stunning visuals. Our
next game is Watchd Dogs, now 75% off.
Now, for my recommended settings, medium
with a 45 fps frame cap. This setup
ensures smooth gameplay while optimizing
power consumption. With these settings,
you can expect a stable experience and a
battery life of around 2.5 hours, making
it the best way to play for most users.
Next is Supermarket Simulator. Currently
25% off. For Supermarket Simulator, I
find the best experience comes with
either the medium preset capped at 60
fps or the high preset with a 45 fps
limit. Both options provide smooth
gameplay, so you can choose based on
whether you prefer higher frame rates or
better visuals. Next up is Tropico 6
with a 65% discount. I'd recommend
switching to medium settings. At this
preset, you'll still enjoy good visuals
while maintaining a more consistent
frame rate of 30 to 40 FPS. By using
this approach, you can strike the
perfect balance between enjoying
Tropico's beautiful environments and
keeping gameplay smooth even during late
game scenarios.
Now, let's talk about battery life.
Playing Tropico 6 on the Steam Deck with
medium settings, I was able to get
around 2 hours of play time on a full
charge. While this isn't the longest
battery life, it's a reasonable
trade-off for the quality of the
experience and the depth of gameplay.
Our next game is Hitman: World of
Assassination, now up to 80% off. Now,
let's talk about my recommended
settings. It's a mix of medium and high
settings, as you can see in the video. I
think this strikes a perfect balance
between performance and visuals. I also
cap the frame rate at 45fps
to ensure everything stays smooth. With
this setup, you'll get around 2.5 to 3
hours of gaming time.
